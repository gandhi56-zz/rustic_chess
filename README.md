# Rustic Chess

## Overview
Rustic Chess is a 3D chess application written in Rust. It uses bevy's game engine for GUI. I followed the tutorials from https://caballerocoll.com/blog/bevy-chess-tutorial/ to write this program and my goal with this project is to explore the Rust programming language and implement more GUI, finish implementing the missing chess rules and anything else I can think of.
